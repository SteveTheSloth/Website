# Personal Website and Portfolio Presentation with Next.js

This is my personal website built using the web development framework Next.js, React components and CSS.

I designed and built this website both as a tool to preset myself, my projects, and my skills, _and_ as an additional portfolio project showing my front-end development skills. 

You can find the website at https://lvcodes.de
